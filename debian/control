Description: Command-line IP address manipulation tool
 ipaddr is a command-line tool for manipulating and querying IP addresses
 and networks. It provides functionality similar to Python's ipaddress module
 but as a standalone CLI utility.
 .
 Features include:
  - IPv4 and IPv6 address normalization
  - CIDR and netmask prefix notation support
  - Network calculations (network, broadcast, host addressing)
  - Address classification (private, loopback, multicast, etc.)
  - Subnet and supernet operations
  - Command chaining for complex operations
  - IPv6-specific features (6to4, Teredo, zone-id)
